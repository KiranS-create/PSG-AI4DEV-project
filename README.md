TrAIge – Clinical Triage Intelligence Platform
TrAIge is a clinical triage and patient management platform designed to assist healthcare providers in prioritizing patient care using structured patient information, clinical history, and vital signs.

The system provides a unified interface for analyzing patient symptoms, organizing medical records, and generating triage recommendations that help hospitals respond faster to critical cases.

The platform integrates patient history analysis, real‑time vital monitoring, and clinical record processing to support efficient decision‑making in emergency and outpatient care environments.

Features
Patient Triage Analysis
TrAIge evaluates patient symptoms and vital signs to determine priority levels and recommend the appropriate medical department.

Clinical Record Processing
The system processes physician notes, uploaded medical reports, and clinical summaries to extract relevant medical information.

Patient History Search
Historical patient records are indexed and searchable to help identify similar past cases and improve contextual understanding.

Evidence‑Based Decision Support
The platform provides evidence cards showing relevant symptoms, historical references, and clinical indicators that contributed to each triage decision.

Medical Record Management
Healthcare providers can upload, store, and review patient medical records, prescriptions, and diagnostic summaries.

Hospital Triage Dashboard
A hospital command center interface displays incoming patients, priority levels, and recommended departments in a structured triage queue.

Administrative Analytics
Administrative tools provide insights into patient inflow, triage activity, and department workload distribution.

System Architecture
The platform consists of several functional modules:

Narrative Processing Module
Extracts structured clinical information from unstructured medical text such as physician notes or uploaded reports.

History Indexing Module
Stores and indexes historical patient data to enable efficient retrieval of relevant past cases.

Admission Orchestrator
Combines patient history and real‑time vitals to calculate triage priority and recommend departments.

Evidence Generator
Provides supporting context for triage decisions by referencing patient data and clinical indicators.

Privacy Protection Layer
Sensitive patient identifiers are filtered and masked to maintain privacy and compliance with healthcare data standards.
